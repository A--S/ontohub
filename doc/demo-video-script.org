* Preparation
  1. be sure to be logged out
  2. be sure that some ontologies exist:
     * FOAF (need to upload from local file, as Hets otherwise thinks it's in the unsupported logic RDF)
     * [[http://openaal.org/download][OpenAAL]] (need to upload from local file, as the ontology is not published in source form)
     * some Common Logic ontologies from COLORE
  3. be sure that some ontologies do not exist:
     * http://pav-ontology.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pav.owl
* Main page
  1. go to http://ontohub.informatik.uni-bremen.de
  2. explain "latest ontologies"
  3. explain "latest comments"
* Ontologies
  1. go to "[[http://ontohub.informatik.uni-bremen.de/ontologies][ontologies]]"
  2. explain one ontology that has more than one entity and axiom
     (some of the COLORE ontologies just have one)
* Entity search
  1. search for "Person"
  2. refine search by "kind:ObjectProperty"
* Registration
  1. register
  2. confirm e-mail
* Ontology upload
  1. go to "ontologies"
  2. "create ontology"
  3. say that one can upload from a local file …
  4. … but actually do upload from a URL:
     * http://pav-ontology.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pav.owl
     * URI defaults to URL, but here one should change it
       (at this point we can not yet look into the ontology!)
     * use http://purl.org/pav/2.0/
     * enter a short name and description; say that further metadata can be added as well
* Ontology view and Hets output
  1. after upload, looking at the ontology's page
  2. explain Hets status: "Hets tells Ontohub about the logic of an imported ontology and about the entities and axioms it contains.  This works across logics, for any logic supported by Hets."
  3. explain the kinds of entities (say that they depend on the logic)
  4. point at "axioms" and "entities" tabs
